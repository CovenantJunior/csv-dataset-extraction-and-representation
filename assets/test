Dear candidate 

Weâ€™re excited about the prospect of you joining the Mustard team! We believe the best way to evaluate a candidate is to give them an assignment that reflects the work they will be doing with us. We want to better understand how you think and communicate ideas in written form. Your responses should highlight the unique perspective and talents you will bring to our team.
